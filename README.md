📄 Document Editor (C++)

A simple object-oriented Document Editor implemented in C++ that allows users to add text and image elements, render formatted output, and save the document to a file.

This project demonstrates the use of classes, vectors, file handling, and string manipulation in C++.

🚀 Features

Add text content to the document

Add image references using file paths

Render the document with formatted image placeholders

Save the rendered document to a text file

Clean and easy-to-understand structure

🛠 Technologies Used

C++

STL (vector, string, fstream)

📌 How It Works

Text elements are stored as plain strings

Image elements are identified by file extensions (.jpg, .png)

During rendering:

Text is printed as-is

Images are displayed as {Image:image_name}

▶️ Sample Output
Hello World
{Image:picture.jpg}

📂 Output File

The rendered document is saved as:

document.txt
